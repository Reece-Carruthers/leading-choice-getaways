            <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Additional security considerations the website could take is to use HTTPS instead of HTTP this is so all request and responses are encrypted (Why is HTTP not secure?, 2021) this would prevent an attacker from seeing sensitive data in plain text during an attack, the GDPR requires you that "to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure you process personal data securely." (Encryption, 2021) and a website such as Leading Choice Getaways will more than likely take payments and have user accounts with personal details so this would be a must.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another security consideration they could take is using prepared statements within SQL code this is to prevent SQL injection. If SQL injection was to occur a hacker could potential destroy or view sensitive data (SQL Injection | OWASP, 2021) and protecting against this is a rule within the GDPR which was quoted above (required to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure you process personal data securely." (Encryption, 2021)).
