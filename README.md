A year 1 project at Northumbria University (2020).

The task was to create a responsive website for a travel agents called 'Leading Choice Getaways'. To create the website I was only allowed to use basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript alongside PHP for interacting with a SQLite database.

The repo contains all code and wireframe mock-ups of the website.

This was a good introduction to web technologies. If I were to go back to this task I would love to use a framework for the front-end such as React and perhaps a CSS framework like Boostrap or Tailwind.
